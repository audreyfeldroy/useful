What is Useful?
===============

`useful` is my own personal Python learning playground.

It consists of:

* A bunch of example Python code snippets, often demonstrating use of PyPI packages.
* Sphinx's autodoc for ease of browsing.

Its purpose is:

* To provide myself with simple examples of common Python tasks.
* To show myself how various Python packages can be used, in an isolated manner.
* To be a personal learning playground where I can experiment with Python on my own and discover useful Python packages for my own use.

It is most definitely *not*:

* A portfolio (Don't judge the code, please!)
* A reusable module to be imported (that's why it's not on PyPI)
* A usage guide (Don't do what I do! You have been warned.)
